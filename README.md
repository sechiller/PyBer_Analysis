# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

### Purpose
  For this project, V. Isualize has asked for a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type, including a multiple-line graph and a written report that summarizes the differences in the date by city type. Python, Pandas, DataFrames, and Matplotlib should all be used to complete the analysis.

## PyBer Analysis Summary

Recommendations to the CEO would be to incentivize drivers in suburban and urban areas, lower prices per ride in rural and suburban areas, and rise the price per driver in urban envronments. It is also a good idea to review data based on ride length and mileage to better understand any disparaties further.
